# High-Cost-Patients-Analytics
This project contains an end-to-end data analytics workflow for identifying and understanding high-cost healthcare patients.

It includes:
1) A Python notebook that performs data import, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

2) A Power BI dashboard that visualizes patient characteristics, cost drivers, and risk factors.

3) An exported Excel dataset created after cleaning and feature processing steps.

The goal of the project is to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare by predicting which patients are likely to generate high future costs, and by exploring the factors that influence those costs.
